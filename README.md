# Tileset Search File

This repo contains a couple of Python scripts that parse LimeZu's Modern [Exteriors](https://limezu.itch.io/modernexteriors)/[Interiors](https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors) tilesets and generate an HTML file that can be used to preview, explore and search all the tiles in the tileset.

If you want to try it, you can find the most recent version on [itch.io](https://4kxz.itch.io/limezu-tileset-search). The files here are used to generate an up-to-date version.

## How to update the file

Before running the commands below, create a directory named `dist` at the root of this project and copy the uncompressed `modernexteriors-win` and `moderninteriors-win` directories into it. In order to run the scripts you will need to install Python 3 and the script dependencies. This can be done with the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python process.py
python template.py dist/data.json > output.html
```

It can take a while to run and hog the CPU, as it does a brute force search.

The `notebooks` directory contains a few notebooks I used to debug issues with the tile-matching code, jupyter is not actually required to update the files.
